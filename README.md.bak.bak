# node-server
example node server with ts

## Running with Docker

- Uses Node.js version 22.13.1 (slim image)
- Exposes port `3001` (mapped to host `3001`)
- Production build runs as a non-root user for security
- Installs dependencies using `npm ci` for reproducible builds

### Environment Variables
- You can provide a `.env` file in the project root to set environment variables (see `.env.example` for reference)
- Uncomment the `env_file` line in `docker-compose.yml` if you want to use your `.env` file

### Build and Run

```sh
# Build and start the app
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Notes
- All dependencies are installed and the TypeScript code is built inside the container
- No database service is included by default; add one to `docker-compose.yml` if needed
